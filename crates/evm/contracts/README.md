# Quartz Solidity
A Solidity project for the Quartz contract, utilizing Foundry for testing and deployment. This contract integrates with the DCAP attestation system on the Sepolia testnet, providing secure attestation and session management.

## Prerequisites
Foundry: Install Foundry by running:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Environment Variables: Set up a .env file in the project root with your private key and Sepolia RPC URL (alchemy or any other provider):
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL_SEPOLIA=https://eth-sepolia.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY
```

## Testing
Run tests on the Sepolia testnet using Foundry. This command forks the Sepolia network, allowing tests to run against real contract data.
This is so we can easily use the deployed attestation contract on sepolia, and not deploy everything ourselves. It does not require Sepolia ETH, as it forks the blockchain state at that block.

```bash
source .env
forge test --fork-url $RPC_URL_SEPOLIA
```

## Project Structure
- src/: Contains the Quartz contract source code.
- script/: Deployment scripts using Foundryâ€™s forge script.
- test/: Test files for Quartz contract functions and features.

## Temporary quartz documentation
Just keeping this here so I can make notes, and add this to the overall docs when I am done

```bash
# get sepolia forked
source .env
anvil --fork-url $RPC_URL_SEPOLIA

# deploy CYC test token
forge script script/DeployMockERC20.s.sol:DeployMockERC20 --fork-url $SEPOLIA_FORK_URL --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIV_KEY --broadcast

# deploy transfers app
forge script script/DeployTransfers.s.sol:DeployTransfers --fork-url $SEPOLIA_FORK_URL --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIV_KEY --broadcast

# call into a contract with forge
cast call 0xD747b295f6F6BC85081fEb484623FE8faAa60aE1 "getAllRequests()" --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_FORK_URL
