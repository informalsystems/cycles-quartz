# Transfers

This is a simple Quartz demo app, complete with Keplr-based frontend. 
It allows users to deposit funds to a contract, 
transfer them around privately within the contract's encrypted state,
and withdraw whatever funds they have.

See the [getting started guide](/docs/getting_started.md) to get it quickly
setup on a local testnet without SGX or on a real testnet using an Azure SGX
node.

See this [video of an early demo of the app at the Flashbots
TEE-salon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Tv6k02zvBc&t=2517s).
