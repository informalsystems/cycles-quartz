# Transfers

This is a simple Quartz demo app. It allows users to deposit funds to a
contract, transfer them around privately within the contract's encrypted state,
and withdraw whatever funds they have.

See the [getting started guide](/docs/getting_started.md) to get it quickly
setup on a local testnet without SGX or on a real testnet using an Azure SGX
node.
