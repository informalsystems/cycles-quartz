# Getting Started

Here you'll get quickly up and running with an example Quartz application.

You can run this locally using a "mock" enclave (i.e. without real privacy or
attestations), or you can get access to a machine with Intel SGX enabled to run it securely.

TODO sections:

- Transfer Application - describe basic application
- Local Mock SGX - describe getting up and running locally with mock sgx (old demo instructions, updated with new quartz CLI)
- Real SGX - describe how to get setup quickly with SGX e.g. on Azure, and how to run the same example there
- Public Testnet - describe how to deploy on Neutron testnet
